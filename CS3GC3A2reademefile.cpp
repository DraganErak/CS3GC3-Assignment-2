//Some important notes:

	//I was not able to get friction mode working properly, it just turns gravity on and off. But it will make the program 
		//not run properly, so use it last if you must.
	//For the extra features I did:
		//1) Particle Trail
		//2) I did not implement a second extra feature.
		
		
		
//The particle stream will start working right when the program is run.

//Click "r" to reset the list of all shapes to a blank scene.
